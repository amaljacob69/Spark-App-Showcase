## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Paradise Restaurant Menu System seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to: **security@paradise-family-restaurant.com** (or create a private security advisory on GitHub)

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue promptly
- We will notify you when the issue has been fixed

## Security Measures

### Application Security

- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- **Admin Authentication**: Secure password-based admin access with rate limiting
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with timeout
- **HTTPS Only**: Production deployment enforces HTTPS
- **Content Security Policy**: Implemented to prevent XSS and data injection

### Data Protection

- **No Sensitive Data Storage**: No customer personal data is stored
- **Local Storage Security**: Only non-sensitive application state is stored locally
- **Secure API Communications**: All API communications use secure protocols

### Infrastructure Security

- **Firebase Security Rules**: Properly configured Firestore security rules
- **CORS Configuration**: Appropriate CORS settings for API endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak system information

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
2. **Validate all inputs**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs
3. **Use TypeScript**: Leverage type safety to prevent common vulnerabilities
4. **Secure dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies and run security audits
5. **Follow OWASP guidelines**: Implement OWASP security recommendations

### Authentication & Authorization

```typescript
// Example of secure admin check
const validateAdminAccess = (password: string): boolean => {
  // Use secure password comparison
  return securityManager.validatePassword(password)
}
```

### Data Handling

```typescript
// Example of input sanitization
const sanitizeInput = (input: string): string => {
  return input.trim().replace(/[<>]/g, '').substring(0, 1000)
}
```

## Security Testing

We implement multiple layers of security testing:

### Automated Testing
- **Dependency scanning**: Regular automated scans for vulnerable dependencies
- **SAST (Static Analysis)**: Code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Security linting**: ESLint security rules enforcement

### Manual Testing
- **Penetration testing**: Regular manual security assessments
- **Code reviews**: Security-focused code reviews for all changes
- **Authentication testing**: Verification of admin access controls

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Responsible Disclosure
We follow responsible disclosure practices:
1. Investigation and fix development
2. Security advisory publication
3. Coordinated public disclosure
4. Credit to security researchers (if desired)

### Public Security Advisories
