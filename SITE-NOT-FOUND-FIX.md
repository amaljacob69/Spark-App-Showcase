# 🚨 Site Not Found - Troubleshooting Guide

## The Issue
You're seeing "site not found" because the Paradise Family Restaurant app hasn't been deployed to Firebase Hosting yet.

## ✅ What's Already Set Up
- Firebase project configuration ✅
- Authentication system ✅  
- Firestore database ✅
- All application code ✅
- Build configuration ✅

## ❌ What's Missing
- The application hasn't been built into deployable files
- The built files haven't been uploaded to Firebase Hosting

## 🛠️ How to Fix This

### Step 1: Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
```
This creates a `dist/` folder with your compiled application.

### Step 2: Deploy to Firebase
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
After running deploy, you'll see output like:
```
✅ Build completed successfully!
🚀 Deploying to Firebase...
🎉 Deployment successful!
Your app is now live at:
- https://paradise-family.web.app
- https://paradise-family.firebaseapp.com
```

## 🔄 Alternative Methods

### Method 1: Use the deploy script
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### Method 2: Manual Firebase commands
```bash
# Build first
npm run build

# Then deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## ⏱️ Timeline
- **Build time**: 1-2 minutes
- **Deploy time**: 2-3 minutes  
- **DNS propagation**: 5-10 minutes (worst case)

## 🎯 After Deployment

Your restaurant menu will be available at:

### 🌐 Main URLs:
- **Primary**: https://paradise-family.web.app
- **Secondary**: https://paradise-family.firebaseapp.com

### 📱 QR Code URLs (for different dining areas):
- **Non-AC Area**: https://paradise-family.web.app?menu=dinein-non-ac
- **AC Area**: https://paradise-family.web.app?menu=dinein-ac  
- **Takeaway Counter**: https://paradise-family.web.app?menu=takeaway

## 🔐 Admin Access

1. Visit any of the URLs above
2. Click "Admin Login" button
3. Sign in with your Google account
4. If it's your first time, manually add your email to Firestore:
   - Go to Firebase Console → Firestore
   - Create collection: `admins`
   - Add document with your email as ID
   - Set: `{ email: "your@email.com", isActive: true }`

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

1. **Clear browser cache** and try again
2. **Wait 10 minutes** for DNS propagation
3. **Check Firebase Console** → Hosting section
4. **Run verification**: Open browser console and type `verifyDeployment()`

## 📞 Need Help?

If you continue seeing "site not found":
1. Check if `dist/` folder exists after building
2. Verify Firebase CLI is logged in: `firebase login`
3. Check project ID matches: `firebase projects:list`
