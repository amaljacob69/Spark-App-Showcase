  - Primary (navy): White text (excellent contrast 10:1)
  - Accent (gold): White text (good contrast 4.8:1)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Playfair Display (elegant serif) for headings paired with Inter (clean sans-serif) for body text
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear size relationships with Playfair for restaurant name/headings, Inter for descriptions and UI

- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Gentle hover states on cards and buttons; smooth modal transitions for admin functions
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Refined, subtle animations that enhance rather than distract from content

### UI Elements & Component Selection

  - Cards for menu items with clear typography hierarchy
  - Dialog modals for admin functions (login, add/edit items)
  - Button variants for different action priorities
  - Form inputs with clear labeling for admin panel

- **Technical Constraints**: Browser storage limitations, image handling for menu items

## Implementation Considerations
