# ðŸ”’ Firebase Security Rules - Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Validation

### âœ… Security Rules Review
- [x] **Authentication**: Only verified Google accounts can access admin features
- [x] **Data Validation**: Complete validation of menu item structure and pricing
- [x] **Access Controls**: Public read, admin-only write for menu data
- [x] **Admin Protection**: Prevents admin self-deletion, validates admin data structure
- [x] **Rate Limiting**: Basic protection against abuse (timestamp validation)
- [x] **Default Deny**: All unspecified access is denied

### âœ… Data Structure Validation
- [x] **Menu Items**: Validates ID, name, description, prices, category, availability
- [x] **Pricing Structure**: Ensures all three price tiers (non-AC, AC, takeaway) are present
- [x] **Price Ranges**: Validates prices between 0-10,000 to prevent unreasonable values
- [x] **Admin Records**: Validates email format, timestamps, and boolean flags
- [x] **Item Limits**: Restricts menu to maximum 100 items

### âœ… Security Features
- [x] **Email Verification**: Requires verified email for admin operations
- [x] **Active Status Check**: Only active admins can perform write operations
- [x] **Type Safety**: Enforces strict data types for all fields
- [x] **Input Sanitization**: Validates all input data before writes
- [x] **Audit Trail**: Requires timestamps for all data changes

## Deployment Commands

### 1. Validate Rules Locally
```bash
# Check syntax
firebase firestore:rules:test --input=firestore.rules

# Start local emulator for testing
firebase emulators:start --only firestore
```

### 2. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Deploy security rules only
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy specific project
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project paradise-family
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check deployed rules
firebase firestore:rules:get

# View in console
open "https://console.firebase.google.com/project/paradise-family/firestore/rules"
```

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Test Cases to Verify

#### âœ… Public Access
- [ ] **Menu Read**: Public users can view menu items
- [ ] **No Anonymous Write**: Unauthenticated users cannot modify menu
- [ ] **Direct URL Access**: Menu type URLs work correctly

#### âœ… Admin Authentication
- [ ] **Admin Login**: Google authentication works for admin users
- [ ] **Admin Write Access**: Admins can add/edit/delete menu items
- [ ] **Admin Panel Access**: Admin interface loads correctly
- [ ] **Firebase Sync**: Changes sync to Firebase correctly

#### âœ… Data Validation
- [ ] **Valid Menu Item**: Properly structured items are accepted
- [ ] **Invalid Data Rejection**: Malformed data is rejected
- [ ] **Price Validation**: Price ranges are enforced
- [ ] **Required Fields**: Missing fields are rejected

#### âœ… Admin Management
- [ ] **Admin Creation**: New admins can be added by existing admins
- [ ] **Self-Protection**: Admins cannot delete their own accounts
- [ ] **Access Control**: Only admins can manage admin accounts

## Security Monitoring

### Firebase Console Monitoring
1. **Navigate to**: [Firebase Console > Firestore > Rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/paradise-family/firestore/rules)
2. **Monitor**: Rule execution, violations, and performance
3. **Set Alerts**: Configure notifications for unusual activity

### Key Metrics to Track
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rule violations and denials
- Unusual write patterns
- Large data uploads
- Admin account changes

## Emergency Procedures

### Admin Lockout Recovery
If all admin accounts are locked:
1. Go to Firebase Console > Firestore Database
2. Navigate to `admins` collection
3. Manually add admin document:
   ```json
   {
     "email": "your-admin@email.com",
     "addedAt": "2024-12-19T00:00:00Z",
     "isActive": true
   }
   ```

### Rule Rollback
If issues arise with new rules:
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```
